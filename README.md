Aorta or FL4K if you wanna . I'm a synpath and a copinglinker  

I'll be moving around the map fairly often  
on offline mode roughly 75% of the time  

that being said,  
🟢 - probably actively staring at pt; either people watching or talking with someone  
🌙 - asleep, offtab or afk (don't expect a response)  
⛔ - shitty mood, 50/50 on replies  

generally , if My pony is sleeping , I probably am irl too  
strangers covering Me ***will*** be sat on .
